Addiks PHP-SQL Database
===================================

This projects's goal is to create an SQL-compliant database completely written in PHP.
It's purposes are wide ranged:
 - It can be used to mock an temporary in-memory database for unit-tests.
 - The SQL-Parser can be used to extract valuable information from extenral SQL-queries.
 - This database does not depend on php-modules or a seperate server, it just works.
 - The obligatory learning-by-doing purpose

(To be honest, everyone knew it was only a matter of time until some maniac
 writes a full SQL-database in PHP, and well... here it is.)
